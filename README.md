# FizzBuzz

A simple implementation of the classic FizzBuzz game in Java. The FizzBuzz game is often used as a programming exercise to teach division, loops, and conditionals. In this game, the program iterates through a series of numbers and prints different outputs based on specific conditions:
1. Prints "Fizz" for numbers divisible by 3.
2. Prints "Buzz" for numbers divisible by 5.
3.  Prints "FizzBuzz" for numbers divisible by both 3 and 5.
4. Prints the number itself if none of the above conditions are met.
